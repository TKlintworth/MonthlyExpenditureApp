# MonthlyExpenditureApp
Angular/Ionic/Firebase app to track monthly expenses and manage your budget.

I will revamp this app with react tech stack trying to understand the codebase for now.

Not going to use this codebase completely removed old coldbase.

Need to come up with tasks and deliveriables:
Decide which tech stack and why?
Design UI 
Mobile or web?

Angular/React
Ionic
Firebase for database
