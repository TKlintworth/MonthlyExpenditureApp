# MonthlyExpenditureApp
Angular/Ionic/Firebase app to track monthly expenses and manage your budget.

I will revamp this app with react tech stack trying to understand the codebase for now.

Not going to use this codebase completely removed old coldbase.

Need to come up with tasks and deliveriables:
Decide which tech stack and why?
Design UI 
Mobile and web application

Angular/React Ionic
Firebase for database

To Do Lists:
Come up with architecture (end to end) draw it out have a plan view with features
Focusing on health/fitness app
Host it on cloud aws/gcp
Containerzie the app
Have some added on AI features
Creating from scratch
